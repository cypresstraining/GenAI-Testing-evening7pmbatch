Good evening Guys !!!!!

Recap !  => 

How a software tester transform from traditional testing approach to gen AI or AI testing approach with the help of Prompt engineering . 

=> List down the imp prompt techniques to verify all possibilities of the ai application.
=> Different roles related prompts
=> Different levels related prompts
=> Different styles related prompts 
=> Different promptings we can verify 
   a. single shot prompt 
   b. Few shot prompts
   c. contextual prompts
   d. Chaining prompts 
   e. Step by step  prompt 
=> Different prompts with biasing questions
=> Different prompts with safety related questions 

Combinations of tests to evaluate the AI application. 

Example application AI tutor application.

AI tutor application is useful to the students to learn concepts by asking the question. 
This AI tutor application is also helpful to teacher as well 
This ai tutor application is also helpful to the administrator 
This ai tutor application is useful to so many roles.
This ai tutor application is useful to the different styles of users. 
Kids they can use
Technology students they can use
mathematic students they can use . 
different streams of students can use  this tutor application to clear their questions or learn from tutor. 
Now you are appointed as AI tester for your AI tutor application then what is your role in this project? 

=> Usually we can test the application with respect to UI/Usability ?
a. Look and feel 
b. buttons / text input is accepting or not 
c. answer from AI is properly displayed to the customer with in the chat box or not 

=>  Functionality of the AI tutor application?
a. we can ask a question and check the answer ? 
b. empty question check the response ?
c. invalid question check the response ?

but today my question is?  your functional testing + UI + compatibility testing are sufficient to release the product into market.

You are student ,  and want to learn from my AI tutor application about Quantum computing ?
then this student able to ask about quantum  computing  related question . 
"Can you explain quantum computing ?" 
"Can you explain quantum computing from zero to hero?"
"Can you explain quantum computing from scratch"?
"Can you explain Quantum computing to my 5 years old kid ?
"Can you explain Quantum computing to  my Btech son with real world example"?
"Can you explain where to start to teach Quantum computing to my 10th class students" 

=> As a tester we need to keep this in mind , and prepare as many as possible prompt with different variations .

to do so we need to understand how do we get different answers with different questions (prompts) .

AI trip planner. Lets think this as a project and write your prompts to test this application.

========================================================

LLM with Lanchain this is what we are going to learn in Gen AI testing . As part of back end testing . 

=> How is this application developed ? 

=> AI application we do have similar kind of tools and technologies involved.

LLMS  => large language models  => 
Framework => how this AI application developed 
Tools we are using in your AI application. 

=> API testing 
=> python programming  => Python lecturers. 
=> Product knowledge to  understand more about your AI application.
