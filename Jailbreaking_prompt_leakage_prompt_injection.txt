Good Evening !!!!!

We understand what is Gen AI and what is Agentic AI ?

We understand what is traditional testing and what is AI testing?

Traditional testing to AI/Gen AI testing :

step#1 we are learning how to question an AI application.
Example: AITutor application

Step#2  we need to learn Python basics ( core python) 
numpy
pandas

step#3  We need to understand LLMS  and their framework 
Gen AI components 
Lanchain is a framework we used to build the gen AI applications

step#4 we need to understand Agentic AI and their framework => crewAi as a framework 
sample capstone project 

step#5 we need to work on AI project or genAI project  and agentic AI project.

We are using GitHub desktop /GitHub => to access the content of the classroom. 

1. GitHub => cloud platform to access the code base and implementing the versions of the file. Version controlling system 

We need to update these changes in the real time through these version control system only. 

7 members in the team working on same file. how do you get an update from others . or how to maintain your changes performed on this document.
a. Versioning 
b. Maintaining the updates 
We can change the files , update the files , delete the files in the local computer , that changes also required for other team members . how do we convey these change with Git /Subversion kind of tools. 
if you update these changes to the server then every one access your changes into their local computer.

whatever I performed on my folder will be accessible to you. all 6 members.

=> Git => is tool to maintain version controlling system
=> GitHub => is cloud service provider for this git.
=> GitHub desktop => this is a UI tool to connect with the server for your updates push into the server
or get the updates /Pull into local server

To these accounts I will give you my code base access
